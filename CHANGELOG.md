# Changelog

All notable changes to KERNEL are documented in this file.

## [6.1.2] - 2026-03-08

### Fixed
- **Command format** - Converted all commands from XML to YAML frontmatter (Claude Code requirement)
- **Build skill format** - Added missing YAML frontmatter to skills/build/SKILL.md
- **Frontmatter fields** - Added `name`, `description`, `user-invocable`, `allowed-tools` to all commands

### Changed
- Commands now use standard YAML frontmatter instead of custom XML tags

## [6.1.1] - 2026-03-08
