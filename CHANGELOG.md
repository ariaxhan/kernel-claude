# Changelog

All notable changes to KERNEL are documented in this file.

## [7.0.3] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed
- **Hook scripts self-location** - All hooks now use `SCRIPT_DIR` to locate plugin binaries instead of relying on env vars. Fixes "agentdb not found" errors from v7.0.2.

### Enhanced
- **Session start output** - Now shows 5 recent git commits (not just 1) for better project context

---

## [7.0.2] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed
- **Hook scripts env vars** - Fixed all 5 hook scripts using wrong env vars (`CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT`, `CLAUDE_PROJECT_ROOT`). Now correctly use `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` which is set by Claude Code's hook executor.
- **Context skill conflict** - Renamed `skills/context/` to `skills/context-mgmt/` with name `kernel:context`. The old `name: context` shadowed Claude's native `/context` command.

### Changed
- **Skill invocation** - Context skill now invoked as `/kernel:context` to avoid shadowing native `/context`

---

## [7.0.1] - 2026-03-13

### Fixed
- **Hook portability** - Replaced `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` with `${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}` in hooks.json. `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` is broken in Claude Code's hook executor ([issue #24529](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/24529)).

---

## [7.0.0] - 2026-03-12

### Changed
- **Research-first workflow** - Research phase now mandatory before implementation
- **Skill references** - Skills link to research docs in `skills/*/reference/`
- **AgentDB contracts** - Tier 2+ requires contracts before spawning agents

---

## [6.1.5] - 2026-03-08

### Fixed
- **Command namespacing** - Commands now explicitly include `kernel:` prefix in name field (e.g., `name: kernel:ingest`)
- Commands now appear as `/kernel:ingest` instead of `/ingest` in autocomplete

---

## [6.1.2] - 2026-03-08

### Fixed
- **Command format** - Converted all commands from XML to YAML frontmatter (Claude Code requirement)
- **Build skill format** - Added missing YAML frontmatter to skills/build/SKILL.md
- **Frontmatter fields** - Added `name`, `description`, `user-invocable`, `allowed-tools` to all commands

### Changed
- Commands now use standard YAML frontmatter instead of custom XML tags
- All commands include `user-invocable: true` for slash command registration

---

## [6.1.1] - 2026-03-08

### Fixed
- **Commands not loading** - Added explicit `commands` array to plugin.json (commands require explicit registration, unlike skills which auto-discover)
- **Plugin manifest** - Added `skills`, `agents`, `hooks` fields for proper component registration
- **Marketplace sync** - Updated version and description to match plugin.json
