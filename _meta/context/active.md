# Active Work

**Current focus and in-progress tasks.**

## Now

Aligning KERNEL plugin with CodingVault _meta system.

## Tasks

- [x] Create _meta folder structure
- [x] Create session tracking files
- [ ] Update .claude/CLAUDE.md to reference _meta
- [ ] Document alignment changes

## Context

- Researched aws-aoh-hackathon structure as reference
- Key differences: aws uses `_meta/` for research, `.claude/research/` for Claude outputs
- KERNEL plugin was using `memory/` and `kernel/state.md` instead

## Files Touched This Session

- `_meta/_session.md` - Created
- `_meta/_learnings.md` - Created
- `_meta/context/active.md` - Created (this file)
- `_meta/INDEX.md` - Created
- `_meta/research/` - Created directory
