## Gaps and Limitations

- **No peer-reviewed replication studies** of the foundational GEO paper's 40% visibility boost claims. The field is still largely based on one Princeton study plus industry anecdotes.
- **Measurement is immature.** Close to 80% of survey respondents don't believe the way they measure LLM visibility is accurate (Kevin Indig, 2025). AI responses are probabilistic and vary per user.
- **Long-term ROI data is scarce.** Most case studies cover months, not years. The Vercel case (6 months of tracking) is among the longest.
- **Platform-specific optimization research is thin.** We know ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Claude have different citation preferences, but systematic comparative studies are missing.
- **Small/medium business perspective is underrepresented.** Most data comes from enterprise sites or tech companies. Leanne Wong's small-site case study is a rare exception showing <0.001% AI traffic impact.
- **Geographic bias.** Almost all research is US-centric. AI search adoption patterns may differ significantly in other markets.
- **No consensus on terminology.** GEO, AEO, LLMO, AI SEO, LLM SEO, AISO -- the field lacks agreed-upon naming, making research discovery harder.
- **Counter-voices are underrepresented.** Most sources are from companies selling GEO tools or services. Independent skeptical analysis (beyond Glenn Gabe's traffic data) is limited.
