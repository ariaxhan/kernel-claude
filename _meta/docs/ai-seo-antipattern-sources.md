## 1. Failed SEO Strategies in the AI Era

### Primary/Authoritative

- [The State of SEO in 2025: What Worked, What Flopped, & What's Next](https://befoundonline.com/blog/the-state-of-seo-in-2025-what-worked-what-flopped-whats-next)
  - Authority: Be Found Online, established SEO agency
  - Key insight: Mass AI content, keyword stuffing, paid backlinks, and ignoring user intent are the top strategies that flopped. The December 2025 Core Update evaluates content collectively (site-wide patterns), not page-by-page, catching AI content uniformity.

- [5 Common SEO Mistakes to Avoid in 2026's AI Search Era](https://theinstaserv.com/5-common-seo-mistakes-to-avoid-in-2026s-ai-search-era/)
  - Authority: InstaServ digital marketing consultancy
  - Key insight: Over-optimizing meta tags is pointless -- AI systems now compose their own titles/descriptions. Ignoring user intent and focusing only on features misses searchers whose true intent is contextual.

- [Which SEO Practices Are Becoming Obsolete with AI Search?](https://www.plandigi.com/blog/obsolete-seo-practices-ai-search/)
  - Authority: PlanDigi SEO consultancy
  - Key insight: Buying backlinks is "structurally incompatible" with how AI evaluates authority in 2026. AI systems assess trust, intent, and context -- not link tallies.

  - Expert: Olga Zarr, SEO consultant
  - Angle: Practical breakdown of what stopped working vs. what persists. Enterprise companies that spent big on AI SEO tools in 2024-2025 are realizing the ROI was not there.

## 2. Expert Warnings About AI SEO Mistakes

### Primary/Authoritative

- [The Vicious Cycle of SEO: How We Got Here & Where We're Going -- Lily Ray, SEO Week 2025](https://ipullrank.com/seo-week-2025-lily-ray)
  - Authority: Lily Ray, VP of SEO at Amsive Digital, one of the most cited SEO experts globally
  - Key insight: Thousands of companies generating most of their revenue from SEO lost 85-95%+ of traffic and visibility overnight after Google crackdowns. There have been "little to no recoveries" among many affected companies. AI content currently performs well despite violating guidelines but faces a predicted crackdown in 2026.

- [Lily Ray on Google's Generative-AI Web Spam Problem](https://www.ericschwartzman.com/lily-ray/)
  - Authority: Eric Schwartzman's Earned Media podcast featuring Lily Ray
  - Key insight: Generative AI has intensified the SEO cycle, flooding results with repetitive, low-value content and pushing Google into harsher enforcement. Traces the recurring cycle: new tactics emerge, competitors replicate, Google responds with algorithm updates.

- [SEO Expert Says Websites Lose Rankings Because They're Doing Too Much SEO](https://ppc.land/seo-expert-says-websites-lose-rankings-because-theyre-doing-too-much-seo/)
  - Authority: PPC Land, industry publication
  - Key insight: Excessive SEO optimization itself now triggers Google's enforcement systems. Recovery from penalties requires years of sustained effort. Websites lose rankings from "doing too much SEO."

- [SEO Survives AI Search Disruption as Expert Challenges Industry Hype](https://ppc.land/seo-survives-ai-search-disruption-as-expert-challenges-industry-hype/)
  - Authority: PPC Land, industry news
  - Key insight: Challenges the narrative that SEO is dead. Traditional SEO remains foundational. The hype around new acronyms (GEO, AEO, AIO) is largely semantics repackaging established practices.

- [SEO in the Age of Agents: Takeaways from NYC SEO Week](https://lilyray.nyc/seo-in-the-age-of-agents-takeaways-from-nyc-seo-week/)
  - Authority: Lily Ray's personal blog
  - Key insight: AI Overviews rely on the same ranking signals as traditional search. Original research, accurate information, and useful answers still win. In AI search, "brand authority is the new link building."

## 3. Studies Showing What Reduces AI Citation Likelihood

### Academic/Research

- [GEO: Generative Engine Optimization (Princeton/Georgia Tech/Allen AI/IIT Delhi)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09735)
  - Authority: Published at ACM SIGKDD 2024, top-tier data mining conference
  - Key insight: Keyword stuffing DECREASED visibility by 10% in generative engines. Traditional SEO strategies do not directly translate to AI-driven search. Citation addition, quotation addition, and statistics addition improved visibility by 30-40%. Keyword-based approaches actively hurt.

- [2025 AI Visibility Report: How LLMs Choose What Sources to Mention](https://thedigitalbloom.com/learn/2025-ai-citation-llm-visibility-report/)
  - Authority: The Digital Bloom, AI marketing research firm
  - Key insight: Brand search volume (0.334 correlation) is the strongest predictor of AI citations -- not backlinks. Only 11% of domains are cited by both ChatGPT AND Perplexity. Position #1 organic ranking has only 4.5% correlation with AI Overview citations. Keyword stuffing performs WORSE in AI systems than traditional search. Images/videos "didn't move the needle." Short-form content is "actively penalized."

- [LLMs.txt: Why Brands Rely On It and Why It Doesn't Work](https://seranking.com/blog/llms-txt/)
  - Authority: SE Ranking, established SEO platform
  - Key insight: Analysis of 300,000 domains shows LLMs.txt has no measurable impact on AI citation. Removing it from their predictive model actually improved accuracy -- it introduces "more noise than value."

- [Large Language Models Reflect Human Citation Patterns](https://aclanthology.org/2025.findings-naacl.381.pdf)
  - Authority: Published at NAACL 2025, top NLP conference
  - Key insight: LLMs exhibit strong bias toward already highly-cited papers. Less-cited sources face a compounding disadvantage. The median citation count gap between LLM-generated references and ground truth is 1,257 -- meaning LLMs systematically over-cite popular sources.

- [Citation Accuracy Challenges Posed by Large Language Models](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12037895/)
  - Authority: Published in JMIR Medical Education (peer-reviewed)
  - Key insight: Between 50-90% of LLM responses are not fully supported by cited sources. LLMs produce citations that are "correctly formatted but fictional in content." Even GPT-4o with Web Search has ~30% unsupported individual statements.

### Industry Research

- [State of AI Search Optimization 2026 -- Kevin Indig](https://www.growth-memo.com/p/state-of-ai-search-optimization-2026)
  - Authority: Kevin Indig, former VP Growth at Shopify, G2; one of the most respected growth/SEO analysts
  - Key insight: Classic SEO metrics (domain rating, backlinks) have weak correlation with AI chatbot citations. Content depth, comprehensiveness, and readability have the biggest impact. LLMs are probabilistic -- running the same prompt 5 times, only 20% of brands show consistently. Schema markup and llms.txt are "controversial/excluded" from his recommendations as unproven. LLM visibility is "extremely fragile."

- [How Much Can We Influence AI Responses? -- Kevin Indig](https://www.growth-memo.com/p/how-much-can-we-influence-ai-responses)
  - Authority: Kevin Indig
  - Key insight: LLMs produce "lottery-style outputs." Models have a "Primary Bias" from pre-training data, and how much we can influence or overcome that bias is unclear. Different models weigh sources differently (ChatGPT leans on Wikipedia; AI Overviews cite Reddit more).

## 4. Debunked AI SEO Tactics

### Primary/Authoritative

- [GEO Targeted: Critiquing the Generative Engine Optimization Research](https://sandboxseo.com/generative-engine-optimization-experiment/)
  - Authority: SandboxSEO, practitioner critique by 15-year SEO veteran
  - Key insight: The Princeton GEO study's headline claims are inflated by experimental design. Key flaws: (1) The three winning tactics were the only ones adding NEW content -- conflating content addition with technique effectiveness. (2) Researchers explicitly allowed "fake data" in optimizations, creating artificially unique info unlikely in real scenarios. (3) The baseline prompt pre-favored the winning techniques. (4) Limiting to top-5 results made small movements appear as dramatic 30-40% gains. (5) Single-query limitation oversimplified real-world scenarios.

- [AI SEO 2025: Tricks, Treats & Tactics That Actually Work](https://www.level.agency/perspectives/ai-seo-2025-tricks-treats/)
  - Authority: Level Agency
  - Key insight: Debunks "traditional SEO just doesn't work anymore" claims. Solid SEO still works. Not every site is losing search traffic to AI searches. Traditional SEO is required as the basis for AI search optimization -- not sufficient, but essential.

- [Google Says Doing Optimization for AI Search Is 'the Same' as Doing SEO for Traditional Search](https://searchengineland.com/google-says-doing-optimization-for-ai-search-is-the-same-as-doing-seo-for-traditional-search-466293)
  - Authority: Search Engine Land quoting Google SVP Nick Fox
  - Key insight: Google's own SVP of Knowledge and Information says optimizing for AI search is "the same" as SEO. His advice: just build great sites with great content. This directly undermines the premise that GEO is a distinct discipline requiring separate tools and budgets.

## 5. Tools/Services Considered Snake Oil for AI SEO

### Expert Perspectives

- [Beware the "Generative Engine Optimization" Snake Oil](https://webbiquity.com/ai-in-marketing/beware-the-generative-engine-optimization-snake-oil/)
  - Expert: Tom Pick, B2B digital marketing consultant
  - Key arguments: (1) AI platforms change constantly, making today's tactics obsolete tomorrow. (2) Inconsistent results -- slightly different queries produce wildly different outputs. (3) Cross-platform variability between Gemini, ChatGPT, Perplexity is far greater than Google/Bing/Yahoo variation. (4) Major SEO tool vendors (Semrush, Ahrefs, Serpstat, SE Ranking) already cover these features, eliminating the need for $100M+ GEO startups.

- [The New SEO Sales Tactic: Selling the AI Dream](https://searchengineland.com/new-seo-sales-tactic-ai-dream-463912)
  - Authority: Search Engine Land, tier-1 industry publication; article by Adam Heitzman (20+ year industry veteran)
  - Key insight: Agencies repackage established SEO fundamentals under "AI SEO" or "GEO" branding, positioning them as separate services requiring distinct budgets. Red flags: leading with technology dashboards over business strategy, vague "proprietary algorithm" claims, emphasizing vanity metrics (citation counts) over revenue impact. Warns against invisible text targeting LLMs, content cloaking for AI bots, and scaled content for every prompt variation -- echoes discredited blackhat techniques.

- [The Great AI SEO Scam of Mid-2025](https://theadspend.com/resources/ai-search-scam)
  - Authority: The Ad Spend, marketing consultancy
  - Key insight: Case example of a mid-sized e-commerce company that paid $50,000 to a "Generative Engine Optimization expert." Six months later: zero traffic from AI sources, zero ChatGPT citations, zero Google AI Overview appearances. LinkedIn is flooded with posts announcing the death of traditional SEO and the birth of AEO/GEO/AIO/LLMO. Most North American businesses are being sold expensive AI optimization services to solve a problem that represents less than 1% of total website traffic.

- [Google Suggests AI SEO Acronyms May Lead To Scams & Spam](https://www.seroundtable.com/google-ai-seo-acronyms-scams-spam-39942.html)
  - Authority: Search Engine Roundtable quoting Google's John Mueller
  - Key insight: Google's John Mueller on Bluesky: "The higher the urgency, and the stronger the push of new acronyms, the more likely they're just making spam and scamming."

- [SEO for AI: What Works, What's Snake Oil](https://unofficialshopifypodcast.com/episodes/seo-for-ai-2025-hsBNID13)
  - Authority: Unofficial Shopify Podcast
  - Key insight: Practitioners discuss which AI SEO tools deliver and which are empty promises. Tools claiming "instant success," "scale-automation," or "results overnight" are flagged as snake oil.

## 6. Case Studies of Sites That LOST Visibility

### Documented Traffic Losses

- [The AI Search Reckoning Is Dismantling Open Web Traffic -- And Publishers May Never Recover](https://www.adexchanger.com/publishers/the-ai-search-reckoning-is-dismantling-open-web-traffic-and-publishers-may-never-recover/)
  - Authority: AdExchanger, ad industry trade publication
  - Key insight: Publishers losing 20-90% of traffic and revenue. Organic visits for news publishers plummeted from 2.3B (mid-2024) to under 1.7B (May 2025). Zero-click results for news surged from 56% to 69%. E-commerce sites report 22% drop in search traffic. Publishers have been "surprisingly candid" about losses.

- [Traffic Down, Panic Up: Why AI Is What SEO Needed in 2025](https://www.optimizely.com/insights/blog/traffic-down-panic-up-why-ai-is-just-what-seo-needed-in-2025/)
  - Authority: Optimizely (enterprise CMS platform)
  - Key insight: HubSpot -- the company that wrote the playbook on content marketing SEO -- fell from 24M monthly visitors (2022) to 16M (late 2023), with further crashes in early 2025. Business Insider lost 55% of organic search traffic between April 2022 and April 2025, leading to 21% staff cuts. HuffPost lost half its search referrals. The Planet D travel blog lost half its traffic post-AI Overviews, then another 90% after layoffs, eventually ceasing publication.

## 7. Google/Bing Warnings About Manipulative AI Optimization

### Official Google Policies

- [Google Search's Guidance About AI-Generated Content](https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2023/02/google-search-and-ai-content)
  - Authority: Google Search Central Blog (official Google documentation)
  - Key insight: "Using automation -- including AI -- to generate content with the primary purpose of manipulating ranking in search results is a violation of our spam policies." AI content is not inherently spam, but intent to manipulate is penalized.

- [Google's August 2025 Spam Update Targets AI Content and Fake Links](https://www.webpronews.com/googles-august-2025-spam-update-targets-ai-content-and-fake-links/)
  - Authority: WebProNews reporting on Google's official spam update
  - Key insight: August 2025 update targeted sites using automated content and deceptive links. Expected to cut spammy listings by 20%. Globally applied across all languages.

- [Google Algorithm Updates 2025 in Review: 3 Core Updates and 1 Spam Update](https://omenterprisesgroup.in/blog/Google-Algorithm-Updates-2025-in-Review:%203-Core-Updates-and-1-Spam-Update)
  - Authority: OM Enterprises SEO analysis
  - Key insight: 2025 spam updates targeted manipulative link building, cloaking techniques, and auto-generated content. Sites using private blog networks, link schemes, or sneaky redirects faced severe penalties.

- [Google Downplays GEO -- But Let's Talk About Garbage AI SERPs](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-downplays-geo-but-lets-talk-about-garbage-ai-serps/564901/)
  - Authority: Search Engine Journal
  - Key insight: Google's Danny Sullivan warns against breaking content into "chunks" for LLMs -- a popular GEO tactic. Sullivan: "We don't want you to do that... We really don't want you to think you need to be doing that or produce two versions of your content, one for the LLM and one for the net."

### Bing/Microsoft Policies

- [How Bing Delivers Search Results](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/topic/how-bing-delivers-search-results-d18fc815-ac37-4723-bc67-9229ce3eb6a3)
  - Authority: Microsoft official documentation
  - Key insight: Bing removes or deprioritizes pages with "characteristics that artificially manipulate the way search and advertising systems work." Applies additional algorithmic interventions in areas with "elevated risks of active manipulations." Uses ML models trained on human judges and AI systems with human oversight.

## 8. Practitioner Communities: What Didn't Work

### Reddit/Community Sources

- [Reddit SEO and LLM Optimisation for B2B SaaS: Complete 2026 Playbook](https://saastorm.io/blog/reddit-ai-seo/)
  - Value: Practitioner guide acknowledging that promotional Reddit content gets "destroyed" by the community. Redditors "can smell inauthentic baiting from miles away." Copy-pasting AI output to Reddit is against subreddit rules and detectable.

- [Is Reddit Dead for SEO and ChatGPT? What the Data Says](https://adexpert.io/is-reddit-dead-for-seo-and-chatgpt/)
  - Value: Documents Reddit's January 2025 search visibility drop. Reddit, Quora, and Stack Exchange all saw ranking declines simultaneously, showing platform-level vulnerability.

- [DuckDuckGo's Stark Poll: 90% of Users Spurn AI Search](https://www.webpronews.com/duckduckgos-stark-poll-90-of-users-spurn-ai-search/)
  - Value: Counterpoint data -- 90% of DuckDuckGo users actively reject AI-powered search, challenging the assumption that optimizing for AI is universally important.

### Industry Practitioner Reports

- [New AI Models Are Worse at SEO: Benchmark Shows Sharp Accuracy Drop](https://searchengineland.com/new-models-breaking-seo-workflows-465621)
  - Authority: Search Engine Land
  - Key insight: Claude Opus 4.5 scored 76% (down from 84%), Gemini 3 Pro scored 73% (9% drop), ChatGPT-5.1 scored 77% (down 6%). Models overthink simple instructions, hallucinate complexity, expect massive context, and refuse technical audit requests. Out-of-the-box models no longer reliably handle SEO tasks.

- [9 AI SEO Tools I Tested in 2026 (What Worked & Didn't)](https://selfmademillennials.com/ai-seo-tools/)
  - Value: Hands-on testing showing suggested word counts aren't optimal for high-competition keywords, recommended meta-titles lack creativity, and generated outlines don't always align with user search intent. AI tools "unlikely to help" in YMYL niches.

---

## 9. Princeton GEO Study: What DECREASED Visibility

### The Study

- [GEO: Generative Engine Optimization (Full Paper)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.09735)
  - Authority: Princeton, Georgia Tech, Allen AI, IIT Delhi. Published at ACM SIGKDD 2024.
  - Tested: 9 optimization tactics across 10,000 search queries

### What Decreased Visibility

- **Keyword Stuffing**: Decreased visibility by 10% compared to baseline. Traditional SEO's cornerstone tactic is actively penalized by generative engines.
- **Simple traditional SEO methods**: "Compared to baselines, simple methods like Keyword Stuffing traditionally used in SEO don't perform well" -- consistent finding across all tested generative engines.

### What Increased Visibility (for contrast)

- Cite Sources, Quotation Addition, Statistics Addition: 30-40% improvements
- Best combination (Fluency Optimization + Statistics Addition): outperformed any single strategy by 5.5%
- Cite Sources method: 115.1% increase for websites ranked 5th in SERP

### Methodological Critiques (see source #4)

- [GEO Targeted: Critiquing the GEO Research](https://sandboxseo.com/generative-engine-optimization-experiment/)
  - The winning tactics were the only ones adding new content (confound). Fake data was explicitly allowed. Baseline prompt pre-favored winners. Top-5 restriction inflated percentage gains. The 40% headline number may not translate to real-world conditions.

## 10. Industry Critiques of the "Optimize for AI" Movement

### Skeptic/Critical Sources

- [The Great AI Hype Correction of 2025](https://www.technologyreview.com/2025/12/15/1129174/the-great-ai-hype-correction-of-2025/)
  - Authority: MIT Technology Review
  - Key insight: 95% of businesses that tried using AI found zero value. "The heads of top AI companies made promises they couldn't keep." Even Ilya Sutskever now highlights LLM limitations -- "good at learning specific tasks but do not seem to learn the principles behind those tasks."

- [Why Every AI Search Study Tells a Different Story](https://searchengineland.com/why-every-ai-search-study-tells-a-different-story-465511)
  - Authority: Search Engine Land
  - Key insight: "The study that 'settles it' doesn't exist because the problem is too complex and too variable." We have data points, hypotheses, and business-driven narratives -- not definitive conclusions.

- [AI Search Is Growing, But SEO Fundamentals Still Drive Most Traffic](https://searchengineland.com/ai-search-is-growing-but-seo-fundamentals-still-drive-most-traffic-466620)
  - Authority: Search Engine Land
  - Key insight: Total LLM platform referral sessions amount to only 2-3% of Google organic traffic. ChatGPT, the largest source, reaches at most 4% of current organic referral traffic. Many teams are "overinvesting in the future while underperforming in the present."

- [Don't Believe the Hype -- or Doom -- About AI](https://jacobin.com/2025/12/hype-artificial-intelligence-vc-capital)
  - Authority: Jacobin (political analysis)
  - Key insight: Signal president Meredith Whittaker: "The venture capital business model needs to be understood as requiring hype." AI hype isn't a by-product -- it's structural to the VC-dominated tech economy.

- [Despite the Hype, Publishers Aren't Prioritizing GEO](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-downplays-geo-but-lets-talk-about-garbage-ai-serps/564901/)
  - Authority: Search Engine Journal, referencing Digiday reporting
  - Key insight: Despite all the GEO noise, publishers are not actually prioritizing it in practice. The gap between GEO hype and actual adoption is significant.

- [How Brands Are Trying to Optimize, Outsmart AI Answer Engines](https://digiday.com/marketing/how-brands-are-trying-to-optimize-outsmart-ai-answer-engines-across-the-zero-click-landscape/)
  - Authority: Digiday
  - Key insight: Agency execs caution against quick fixes. An early "cloaking" trick (invisible text for LLMs) is compared to historical blackhat SEO. "There's no shortcut or 'hack' to AI visibility and attempts to game the system will likely backfire, just as they did in the early days of SEO."

### The Counter-Argument (for balance)

- [30-Year SEO Expert: Why AI Search Isn't Overhyped](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/30-year-seo-expert-why-ai-search-isnt-overhyped-what-to-focus-on-right-now/557802/)
  - Expert: Carolyn Shelby, 30-year SEO veteran
  - Angle: Acknowledges less than 1% of traffic comes from AI tools, but argues "1% of a trillion is 10 billion." Warns against ignoring AI entirely. Represents the measured middle ground between hype and dismissal.

---

## Gaps

- **Direct Reddit r/SEO and r/bigseo threads**: Searches returned industry articles about Reddit rather than actual threads. Direct Reddit searching requires platform-specific access. The practitioner discourse is there but harder to systematically surface.
- **Hacker News threads**: No specific HN discussion thread was found critiquing GEO/AI SEO despite HN being a known skeptical community. The discourse likely exists under broader "AI hype" discussions rather than SEO-specific threads.
- **Bing-specific AI content policies**: Microsoft/Bing has less public-facing guidance on AI content manipulation compared to Google. Their policies exist within Webmaster Guidelines but lack the detailed blog posts and public statements Google provides.
- **Longitudinal case studies**: Most "lost visibility" data comes from aggregate analyses, not detailed single-site case studies with before/after data on specific AI optimization tactics. The Planet D travel blog and HubSpot are the closest to individual case studies.
- **Non-English market data**: Nearly all sources are English-language and US/Western-centric. AI SEO antipatterns in non-English markets (where AI search adoption patterns differ) remain underdocumented.
- **Quantified ROI of GEO tools**: No independent audit or comparative study of GEO-specific tools vs. traditional SEO tools has been published. Claims of tool effectiveness are self-reported by vendors.
