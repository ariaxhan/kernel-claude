# Debugging Skill

When debugging issues, refer to **DEBUGGING-BANK.md** for systematic process.

## Quick Process

1. **Reproduce** - Can you trigger it consistently?
2. **Isolate** - Binary search to find exact location
3. **Understand** - Why does this happen?
4. **Fix** - Root cause, not symptom
5. **Verify** - Test fix + edge cases + regression

**Key principle:** Systematic debugging beats random changes.

See DEBUGGING-BANK.md in kernel/banks/ for full checklist, stack-specific techniques, and common patterns.
