# Code Review Skill

When reviewing code, refer to **CODE-REVIEW-BANK.md** for comprehensive checklist.

## Quick Checklist

- Correctness (solves problem, handles edge cases)
- Testing (adequate coverage)
- Security (no injection, XSS, auth issues)
- Quality (clear, maintainable, follows conventions)
- Performance (no obvious bottlenecks)

**Key principle:** Good reviews make the whole codebase better.

See CODE-REVIEW-BANK.md in kernel/banks/ for full checklist, red flags, and stack-specific patterns.
