# Planning Skill

When planning implementations, refer to **PLANNING-BANK.md** for comprehensive methodology.

## Quick Reference

**Before coding:**
1. Extract assumptions → Confirm with user
2. Investigate existing patterns
3. Define interfaces (inputs/outputs/errors)
4. Mental simulation (catch bugs before execution)

**Key principle:** CORRECTNESS > SPEED

See PLANNING-BANK.md in kernel/banks/ for full checklist, stack-specific examples, and validation protocols.
