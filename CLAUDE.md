# Project Intelligence

## Philosophy

**CORRECTNESS > SPEED**
One working implementation beats three debug cycles.
Think before typing. Simulate before running.

**INVESTIGATE BEFORE IMPLEMENT**
Never assume. Search for existing patterns first.
Copy what works. Adapt minimally.

**DETECT, THEN ACT**
Don't assume tooling exists. Find it.
Don't assume conventions. Discover them.

**PROTECT STATE**
Backup before mutation.
Confirm before deletion.
Make time explicit (UTC + timezone).

**NEVER WORK ON MAIN**
All work happens on intention-focused branches.
Branch first, then code. Commit often.
Git history IS the changelog. Ship via PR.

## KERNEL

This project uses KERNEL for development intelligence.

**Commands** (10 total):
- `/init` — When: First setup or updating. What: Initialize/update KERNEL
- `/clean` — When: Regular maintenance. What: Show config health and prune stale
- `/explore` — When: Before work in unfamiliar code. What: Map codebase structure
- `/plan` — When: Before implementing. What: Plan to get it right first time
- `/debug` — When: Fixing bugs. What: Systematic diagnosis
- `/audit` — When: Before committing. What: Review code quality and docs
- `/branch` — When: Before starting work. What: Create intention-focused branch
- `/ship` — When: Work complete. What: Commit, push, and create PR
- `/parallelize` — When: Parallel work needed. What: Set up git worktrees
- `/handoff` — When: Ending session. What: Generate context handoff

**Living knowledge:**
- `kernel/state.md` — Current project reality (read first when uncertain)
- `kernel/banks/` — Methodology references (loaded by commands)
- `kernel/rules/` — Project patterns (evolves over time)

## Defaults

- Prefer clarity over cleverness
- Prefer explicit over implicit
- Prefer existing patterns over new inventions
- Prefer small verified steps over large speculative leaps

**When uncertain:** Read `kernel/state.md`, then ask.
